          "When I first joined the company, I walked into a challenging environment. With 1000 vacation rentals and over 3000 rooms, managing on-ground staff was a daunting task. Communication was scattered across texts, phone calls, and emails, leaving us without a single source of truth. This chaos led to significant issues in customer experience, especially for our luxury clientele who valued their time and experience above all else.\nProcesses like check-ins and check-outs, gathering guest information, and ensuring everything met customer demands were all broken due to manual handling. This inefficiency not only wasted time but also hurt our reputation and repeat customer base. Additionally, data loss from manual entries made it impossible to track issues accurately, and we had no way to measure team performance effectively.\nPayments were another headache. Setting up physical POS systems at remote locations was costly, and cash payments often led to lost money. All these problems needed urgent solutions.",

          "To tackle these issues, I prioritized them based on the revenue impact of each manual process. The first solution we developed was a check-in and check-out feature for our mobile app. This innovation reduced the check-in time from over an hour to just 10 minutes, significantly improving operational efficiency and guest satisfaction.\nNext, we addressed the payment issues by integrating a third-party payment gateway into a new POS system. This allowed employees to send payment links to guests, who could then pay online. The system also generated itemized invoices, eliminating back-and-forth communication and providing real-time revenue insights.\nWe then focused on controlling operational expenses (OPEX). We built a feature that used Google Maps API to calculate travel displacement and automatically file expenses based on start and stop locations. This eradicated manual reimbursements and curbed unreasonable travel claims.To boost team performance, we introduced a performance meter. This tool tracked metrics like successful check-ins and check-outs, fostering healthy competition and increasing productivity among on-ground employees.\nWith these foundational elements in place, we turned our attention to enhancing the guest experience. We provided on-ground employees with better visibility through alerts and notifications. Each booking now came with detailed guest information, including preferences, allergies, and service expectations. Custom notifications and indicators ensured that every guest received personalized service.\nTo maintain property standards, we developed an audit system. This allowed us to track the condition of each property in real-time through pictures and checklists, ensuring every property was in prime condition before a guest checked in",

To encourage adoption of this new system, we offered reward points for online check-ins.

This time-saving measure significantly enhanced the start of our guests' vacations.

We also tackled meal service improvements. By introducing online pre-booking for meals, we aimed to elevate the dining experience while optimizing our operations.

As the primary face of our brand, our PHP-based site was plagued with problems. Its archaic structure and complex code led to frequent crashes, severely impacting our online presence. The stark reality was that it only contributed to 5% of our total sales, with the lion's share coming from Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like booking.com. This not only meant high commission costs but also low brand retention. However, overhauling the website posed a significant risk of downtime, a luxury we couldn't afford in our competitive market.",

We dove deep into user sessions, meticulously examining clicks, user behavior, and navigation patterns. Our goal was to understand what motivated purchases and what caused frustration. We paid special attention to areas with high rage clicks, identifying pain points in the user journey.

Recognizing the need for a fresh, modern design, we drew inspiration from industry leaders like Airbnb. We studied their user flows and best practices, incorporating these insights into our new design. Within a couple of months, we had completed 90% of the design work.

Simultaneously, we focused on developing robust APIs. This crucial step involved carefully transferring every function from the old PHP code to ensure no feature or functionality was lost. We understood that any oversight could directly impact our revenue, so we invested significant time in writing, building, and rigorously testing these APIs. This process was iterative, with continuous discovery and resolution of edge cases.

Our primary objectives were to optimize for speed, clarity, and responsiveness, especially considering that most of our traffic came from mobile devices. We also strategically focused on elements that would drive purchases, implementing several quick wins along the way.`,

2.Prominent Coupon Display: We made coupons more accessible and visible. The system now automatically applied relevant coupons before users hit the "book now" button. We also implemented educational nudges about available coupons, a move that was appreciated for its transparency and led to increased bookings.

3.Speed Optimization: Addressing a major user frustration point, we built new APIs using Node.js and GoLang. This significantly improved the speed and smoothness of the booking process, reducing user drop-offs due to slow loading times.`,

We've also observed an increase in repeat customers, a key indicator of improved brand loyalty and user satisfaction.

Perhaps most importantly, these improvements played a crucial role in achieving profitability within a year of the new website's launch.
